# comp426-cli

This is a collection of the ten assignments that I did for COMP 426, a class primarily rooted in frontend design.

# Assignment 0
Just a primer in HTML, testing how `<strong>` and `<em>` modify text.
  
# Assignment 1
Increased focus in CSS, including handling pseudoclasses and utilizing the HTML hierarchy to make some effects. Overall, this is a really simple, raw HTML site, not 
much to see here.

# Assignment 2
Utilizing the Bulma CSS package to make a simple HTML site look much more sophisticated and nice. This site is nonfunctional, as it was just an experiement in 
working with Bulma instead of actually making a functional site.

# Assignment 3
The first JavaScript assignment, this one handles creating Objects and utilizing prototype functions, such as Array.filter() or Array.map() in order to handle 
large amounds of data in the best way possible. 

# Assignment 4
This assignment was the first one to utilize jQuery, and it's used to render several "cards" that represent different superheroes. This is the first of two 
assignments in this matter, this one just sets up the components, and appends them to the HTML body.

# Assignment 5
This assignment is the second part of Assignment 4, with the first work in event listeners and jQuery rendering as a result of these events. In this assignment, we 
have an edit button that, when clicked, will render an edit form in which we can edit what the hero's name, alter ego, description, etc. are in the card itself.

# Assignment 6
This assignment works with callback functions, promises, and the async/await structure to handle different events. Also included is a strategy of using parallel 
promises.

# Assignment 7
One of the biggest assignments, this assignment required us to design the game 2048. This included handling the mechanics the same way the official game does, such 
as shifting all tiles when a certain arrow key is pressed, collapsing like numbers when they collide, checking if a 2048 is on the board, indicating that the game's 
been won, and checking if no more moves can be made after each term, signaling that the game is over.

# Assignment 8
This is a short assignment, it uses Axios to handle HTTP requests and returning different information encoded in the JSON response opbject afterwards.

# Assignment 9
This is an extension of assignment 8, where I built a variant of twitter, in which tweets could be posted to a backend, and be liked, retweeted, or replied to. This 
utilizes HTTP GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods. The backend requires a user be logged in, and will be nonfunctional in the near future.
